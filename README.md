# nextjs-starter-templates

Next.js starter templates for various applications.

## Note

- If you are going to do something you haven't so far, check [Next.js examples](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/).
- Display all images on the website exclusively in the .webp format and make sure they're optimized pre-conversion and after.
- If internalization/localization is needed go by the [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/i18n-routing) and the [example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/i18n-routing).
